# Hi-Lo
Implementation of a game of [Hi-Lo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic_bo). 

**RULES**

First, the program will pick a random integer between 1 and 100. You are given 7 tries to guess the number.

If you cannot guess the correct number, the program will give you a hint, telling you whether your guess is too high or too low. 

If you can guess the right number, you win. 

If you run out of guesses, you lose. In that case, the program will tell you what the correct number is.
